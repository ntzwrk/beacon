Beacon is a transparent and secure voting software powered by Blockstack's software stack. It lets you issue votes into
a blockchain and other users vote on that. It's based on the corresponding library
[beacon.js](https://github.com/ntzwrk/beacon.js).

Because of Blockstack's properties the app works completely decentralized without having to trust anyone. Beacon uses
decentral naming, identity and storage as provided by [blockstack.js](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack.js).
